# Lindenii Forge

## Organization

URLs are like `https://forge.example.org/category/module`. The `category` may
represent a project on an organization's forge, or perhaps one particular user
on a multi-user public forge. The `module` is similar to a repository on
Forgejo, and may contain any non-empty subset of all available modules.

The available modules are:
* Version-controlled repository hosting
* Patch review
* Mailing list
* Ticket tracker
* Wiki

This is potentially subject to change.
